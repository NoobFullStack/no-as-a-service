  "[TODO:AR] I want to be honest with you—I don’t feel comfortable committing to this.",
  "[TODO:AR] I have to trust my gut—and it's gently suggesting a no.",

  "[TODO:AR] The only thing I'm inclined to say is a decline.",
  "[TODO:AR] Let me put it in a language you understand: No.",
  "[TODO:AR] I'm fluent in 5 languages, and in all of them, the answer is no.",
  "[TODO:AR] 'Yes' and I aren't on speaking terms at the moment.",
  "[TODO:AR] I would respond with a fancy Latin phrase for no, but plain 'no' will suffice.",
