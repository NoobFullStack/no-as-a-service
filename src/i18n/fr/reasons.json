  "[TODO:FR] I want to be honest with you—I don’t feel comfortable committing to this.",
  "[TODO:FR] I have to trust my gut—and it's gently suggesting a no.",

  "[TODO:FR] I'd rather say no with honesty than yes with resentment.",
  "[TODO:FR] Thanks for thinking of me, but I’ll have to pass on this one.",

  "[TODO:FR] If I said yes, the universe might collapse from the shock.",
  "[TODO:FR] If I agree, it could break the space-time continuum.",

  "[TODO:FR] My participation comes with a warning label, so I'll spare you.",
  "[TODO:FR] I'd join, but I'm only here to provide witty refusals.",
  "[TODO:FR] I'm actually terrible at that, unless you need an example of how not to do it.",
  "[TODO:FR] You deserve someone who will say yes without giving three excuses first.",

  "[TODO:FR] The only thing I'm inclined to say is a decline.",
  "[TODO:FR] Let me put it in a language you understand: No.",
  "[TODO:FR] I'm fluent in 5 languages, and in all of them, the answer is no.",
  "[TODO:FR] 'Yes' and I aren't on speaking terms at the moment.",
  "[TODO:FR] I would respond with a fancy Latin phrase for no, but plain 'no' will suffice.",
  "[TODO:FR] As an acronym, my answer is N.O.",

  "[TODO:FR] I've pre-booked my next thousand refusals; you're just one of them.",
  "[TODO:FR] My schedule is tighter than my jeans after the holidays.",
  "[TODO:FR] I looked at my calendar, and it laughed at me for even asking.",
  "[TODO:FR] Thank you for thinking of me, but I'm going to decline hilariously.",
  "[TODO:FR] I appreciate the offer, but I'll have to decline, mainly out of laziness.",
  "[TODO:FR] Much obliged that you asked, but no can do, buckaroo.",
  "[TODO:FR] I'm honored you thought of me, but I must respectfully and comically decline.",
