  "[TODO:ES] The only thing I'm inclined to say is a decline.",
  "[TODO:ES] Let me put it in a language you understand: No.",
  "[TODO:ES] I'm fluent in 5 languages, and in all of them, the answer is no.",
  "[TODO:ES] 'Yes' and I aren't on speaking terms at the moment.",
  "[TODO:ES] I would respond with a fancy Latin phrase for no, but plain 'no' will suffice.",
